    "Your task is to conduct a start-to-finish analysis of a real dataset. This will require many of the skills we have learned over the quarter: from manipulating data, exploratory analysis and dimension reduction, translating scientific questions into models and algorithms, basic regression and classification, and carefully crafted visualizations.  You should present your results in a clear and concise manner. \n",
