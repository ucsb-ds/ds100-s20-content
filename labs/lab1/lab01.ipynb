    "`np.arange(start, stop, step)` produces an array with all the numbers starting at `start`, incremendted up by `step`, stopping **before** `stop` is reached. For example, the value of `np.arange(1, 6, 2)` is an array with elements 1, 3, and 5 -- it starts at 1 and counts up by 2, then stops before 6. `np.arange(4, 9, 1)` is an array with elements 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
